Punch is a bear who is literally strong-headed: his head is as hard as a rock, and nothing can knock him down. Boom the weasel is an expert shot, using not a gun, but a slingshot. Touch the mouse takes advantage of her smallness in order to get into small holes and sneaking into things without the villains knowing. 

Gari-Gari is a mad scientist wolf who wants to build a mansion over the junkyard, constantly thinking up evil plans to get the money needed to buy the property, whether it’s creating a machine that creates counterfeit 10 yen (about 10 cents in US money) or stealing priceless paintings and selling it to a high bidder. He is an inventor, creating things that can aid him into doing his deed. If Gari-Gari buys the junkyard, this of course means that the three heroes will have no place to stay, so they constantly thwart his schemes. Gari-Gari has two henchmen working for him: Black and Nyu. Black is a gangster cat who welds a gun, often shooting at Punch and the gang with it. Nyu is a simple-minded pig who has big strength.

,100ばんめのサル,Movie,1,Finished Airing,"May 25, 1986",,Kyowa Film,add some,add some,Unknown,"Kids, Historical",20 min.,G,N/A,150,0,"Based on the 1981 book of the same name by new age guru Ken Keyes, Jr., which in turn is based on the story of a 1952 experiment on the southern Japanese island of Kojima. (Please note that the ""Hundredth monkey effect"" is discredited in the scientific community.)

Once one monkey has learned how to wash its food, it is able to teach others the same skill. When a certain number have learned (and Keyes suggests an arbitrary figure of 100), not only do the remaining monkeys suddenly appear to know how to do it, but so too does a completely different group of apes on a completely separate island. Keyes uses this apocryphal tale as a parable for the antinuclear movement, as ""proof' that change would come if enough people joined forces.
