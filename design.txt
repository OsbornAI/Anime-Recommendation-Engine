Anime recommendation and classification:
 - We get the euclidean distance between the average of the list vector and the new show, we then sort by the distances and select the shows with the shortest distance
 - We then take these shows and assess the similarities between a sample of the listed show descriptions and the actual show descriptions, then we will determine if it is recommended or not
 
 - The next algorithm will look at listed shows and find users with a threshold amount nof similar shows un their playlist, and then recommend those shows
 - Have a blacklist to not recommend shows that are already in the list
    - When the recommended users falls below a certain amount we will remove values from the blacklist that are not inside of the list
