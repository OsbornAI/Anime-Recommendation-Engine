One animated film filled with the essence of his most famous pieces, and another that introduces a historical episode of Kyoto, are shown as a double feature movie with the Phoenix as a narrator. 

As we know, Tezuka Osamu's most famous work is Astro Boy, which has been popular among all generations. From the huge number of his original Astro Boy series, the episode Ao Kishi no Kan was chosen for screening. It depicts the confrontation between the blue knight, who regards humans as enemies for their dominance over robots and other creatures on the Earth, and Astro Boy, who rejects war because he believes that humans will someday realize their mistakes. 

The Phoenix asks us why humans choose war as a means of solving problems, while it looks back on the history of Kyoto and ponders on the riot at Ikeda-ya by the Shinsengumi in the last days of the Tokugawa regime.

The short film was also included on the Osamu Tezuka Sakuhin-shuu: Kyoto Animation Theater-hen DVD released in 2015.
