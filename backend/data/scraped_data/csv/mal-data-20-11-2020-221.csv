With these words, the mother left Takashi there and went away. Left alone, Takashi was crying. There he met other children who were in the same situation.

One day a nice couple visited this place and took Ken (the cutest) to their home. They seemed to have no children and promised to make him happy. Every one envied him. A gorgeous car arrived. Yet it had the face of the ""SHINDU"" which by force would take away the children. They were called ""SARAIYA"" among the children. Children ran away all at once, but Takashi couldn't make it and was caught and taken into the car. The other children and ""TEN"" prayed, saying ""This can't be helped."" The car went through a big gate and arrived at the place called ""JAIL"". He asked the ""MIHARI"" who would patrol, why he should be treated like this, and a cold answer came back. ""You will be executed in three days."" Three days later, judged by the guards, Takashi was executed. The fact is that in the pet world this happens as a matter of fact, while this is a forcible and absurd procedure in man’s world. The story was replaced in the Buddha's world.
